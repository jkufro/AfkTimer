# AFK Timer PLugin
This is a RuneLite plugin that will notify you
after you have been idle for a specified number
of seconds. The plugin currently calculates idle time
based on the last mouse or keyboard interaction with
the client.

This can be very useful when used in conjunction with
the [DiscordNotifier plugin](https://github.com/jkufro/DiscordNotifier).
